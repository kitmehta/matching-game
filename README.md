# Matching Game - Articulate Storyline 3

## Overview

This is an **interactive memory matching game** built using **Articulate Storyline 3**.

The project demonstrates:  
- Storyline triggers and variables  
- Slide layers and states  
- Drag-and-drop interactivity  
- HTML5 publishing for web deployment
